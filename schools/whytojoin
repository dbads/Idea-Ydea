1. We are interested in connecting institutes around the world.

2. How do we differ from facebook?
    Actually facebook is the superset of all available social networks.its consist the properties of quora,youtube,linkedin,instagram and myspace etc. so the mine, but still if those other could run smoothely then why can't we while we've very exciting plan to amaze people.

3. The students from the lower institutes are always fond of and qurious to know whats happening in the colleges( above them ) and what others from their discipline are doing in their colleges.



4.  Actually even if facebook has lot of things already availabe of what i am thinking but still its incomplete.
