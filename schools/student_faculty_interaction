There is obviously no platform for interactive discussion between student and faculty.
																	I have seen that students don't interact
with faculty members even in class.And almost never outside the class.So schools will be a open platform for such interactive sessions. Ofcourse such sessions may occur at Quora etc but they are not best suited for this or they are not meant for this.

#__Inter_Faculty_Interaction
Like there are guest faculty going to some colleges for some lectures, But its very rare.And very limited.
But if its all is done online, then may happen very oftenly.
											We will provide a way to access the faculty around all the
institutes and students can rate them, this will make facuty people famous never before and some dull faculty members may become a little serious.
