# unlike other social networks :-

* Our priority is not let users chat and do entertainment.Our priority is to connect institutes and then after students
	
* We are planning to connect them not directly while they are always a level seperated to one another. i.e they'll be connected via their schools and colleges.

* Here we are trying to manage institutes like they are our user, i.e they also have their profiles
