Each and every software is made of 1 & 0s ultimately.
So if we could somehow identfy that pattern and store them in less size then, we can transform a given set of 1 & 0s in any software, in any music, videos or anything exist on your PC.

Thus we can save really significant amount of space. And now we'll no more need of whole 1 gb or more size of softwares,Movies and more except a small size pointer to its pattern.

This might be revolutionary!
