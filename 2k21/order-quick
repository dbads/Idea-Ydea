an app 

where you can mark things which just finished or missing in your stock/kitchen, and we'll notify the shops near you who you have subscribed and they will deliver all such
groceries at the end of the day to all the customers

this way, you do not need to remember what all is missing, whenever you see something missing just mark it and it will be delivered.

also, can have a ui device which we can keep in a public place of home and should show list of essentials and can be easily tickable with quantity
