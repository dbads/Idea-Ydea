so in existing dating apps you can swipe on anyone and the opposite person gets to know only when they also swipe on you.

here, I have a thought about making this exciting and more genuine kinda maybe

we can add some common choice/decisional questions which other person has to answer and if they answer correctly then we'll get a notification maybe and we can accordingly attempt their questions and ifwe are able to pass then this will result in a match


... hahah
