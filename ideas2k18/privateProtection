This is a very wide and far future concept.. like there might come a time or situation when there will be to much insecurity and violate. and people might feel need of services/organizations which may provide something kind of private protection.


Here I present the idea of a startup which does so and reduces the probability of riscs as much as possible - 

Type 
	- Internet Based startup

A little bit of intro - 
	- People have to provide kinda of a gps access to them at those times when they want to be wrned or suggested for any harm which might be approaching to them. 

How'll it function - 
	- Like google maps provide the real time position of a person, which could be used for predicting harms and other things around them.. which I guess Google hasn't yet discovered :-))
	and we can work on this.
