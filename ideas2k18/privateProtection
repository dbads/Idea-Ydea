This is a very wide and far future concept.. like there might come a time or situation when there will be to much insecurity and violate. and people might feel need of services/organizations which may provide something kind of private protection.


Here I present the idea of a startup which does so and reduces the probability of riscs as much as possible - 

Type 
	- Internet Based startup

A little bit of intro - 
	- People have to provide kinda of a gps access to them at those times when they want to be wrned or suggested for any harm which might be approaching to them. 

How'll it function - 
	- Like google maps provide the real time position of a person, which could be used for predicting harms and other things around them.. which I guess Google hasn't yet discovered :-))
	and we can work on this.


ALos________________________+=================

here a private defence kinda infrastructure can be created and people can be hired, trained and assigned tasks
and also they need to be payed good

It may work I guess. as people really don't very much believe on police and other gov agencies

The bad people won't mostly ask us for help, it will be just some helpless people or people with money
but not power may ask for help.


Problems------------------

how to know whether sking persons request is gqnuine or not
and both sides may hire us so we'll be fighting against each other. silly?

But still it may have really huge use and all..
